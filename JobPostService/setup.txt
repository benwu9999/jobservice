setup using pycharm
1. This project requires Django which requires MYSQL dependency
install MYSQL dependency (probably a "native" lib)
2. setup MYSQL for data storage, you can either method a) or b)
 a) connect to Google Cloud's SQL instance using Google's "Cloud SQL Proxy"
    See https://cloud.google.com/python/django/appengine
 b) install MYSQL on your local machine, make sure it's running
    a. create database, in mysql client(in terminal type "mysql"):
    create database job_post;
    b. create user to access the new database, this user is from settings.py in this project
    in mysql client, create the user along with password, user and password should match settings.py
    i.e.:
    grant all privileges on job_post.* to 'oneseek'@'localhost' identified by "jobpost8531162";
 c) when creating database for this project, use character set UTF8 to support Chinese characters:
    i.e., if the database job_post already exists, to set it to use UTF8 character set, run this command in mysql client:
    ALTER DATABASE job_post CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
3. In pycharm python integration tools, point pycharm to look at
requirements.txt
4. install pop up should appear in pycharm, install the dependency
5. run manage.py runserver
